# root-suggestion-box

This is a full-stack application built with Next.js for the client-side and Node.js with Express for the server-side. The project is organized into two main directories: client for the frontend and server for the backend.

### 1. Install Root Dependencies

First, install the root-level dependencies by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install
This command will install the dependencies needed to run the scripts that manage both the client and server.

### 2. Install Client and Server Dependencies

To install all necessary dependencies for both the client and server, run the following command from the root directory:

```bash
npm run install:all
```

This command will automatically navigate to the client and server directories and install the dependencies in each.

### 3. Running the Application

To start both the client and server in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Access the Application

After starting the application, navigate to:

```bash
http://localhost:3000/suggestion-boxes
```

This will open the Suggestion Boxes page in your browser.
